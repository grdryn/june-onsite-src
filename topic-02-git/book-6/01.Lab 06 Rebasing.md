# Prerequisites

Time to rewrite history

* Git (2.x)
* (Optional) hub - https://github.com/github/hub
* Fork the repository from https://github.com/feedhenry/git-tutorial


```bash
# Clone the forked repository
git clone git@github.com:<github_username>/git-tutorial.git
```

# Overview

Why rewrite history?

* Git is not only a source control tool, it is also a communication tool
    * Order of commits, logical grouping, good commit messages help to communicate changes
    * Think of the person reviewing your PRs as a potential axe-murderer. Axe murderers hate fix-up commits.
* Golden rule: **Never** rewrite history on shared/public trees

# Rebasing

Rebasing and Merging are two methods that achieve the same goal - the integration of changes from one branch into another branch
